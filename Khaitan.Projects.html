			Description: For this project, me and my partner had to create a game that was fully 
			functional and can be easily used. We made a Mini Golf app and to do so we were goiven 
			some pre-written code and we had to add to this code and try to make the app better. 
			When we first recieved the game, it was full of glitches and bugs and everytihng was messed up. 
			Whenever a new hole would spawn, the initialization would be messed and everytinhg would spawn 
			on top of itelf. We were asked to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIP0CDoGnK3PyMu4xN4Z0tHiUC4qf2v8rD45-p4GwKY/edit?usp=sharing">brainstorm</a>. our 
			ideas so that we could make our app more user friendly.  
			Our plan was to fix the entire initialization from scratch and add extra screens 
			for everytime you get the ball in the hole which tells you waht type of a score you got. 
			We also changed the way the ball reacts to when it is flung so that it was more user friendly. 
			In the end, we had an up that was much more user friendly than before and was much easier 
			to use and play. If you would like to try out our app, you can download it onto your mobile 
			device <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0EjOeTY2-7YR2RSbmRmUUxXek0">here</a>.

		<p>Description: For this project, me and my partner had to create a hangman game using 
		the coding language called Python. We were to use an iPython panel called Canopy that is free 
		to download on any device. It took us about 1 week to make this game from scratch and 
		we were not given any type of pre-written code. We used 4 different functions, many conditionals 
		and a lot of variables.We were able to create a fully working space themed python game with a 
		start, end, play again and along with many different words in a word bank. Since this game was the 
		second of 2 python projects that we have done, it was relatively easier to do this as we had prior 
		experience and we also had other completely working code to refer to in case we had any doubts. If 
		you want to get the code for our game and play it, you can click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B85ini6E8N2ialpKRzhEVHpmOTBWU3BQaWsyWUowdU5TZVhF">here</a>. 
		To play the game, you must copy and paste the code into a code editor like Canopy that is compatible 
		with Python. Run the game and follow the instructions.

		<p>Description: For this project, we had exactly 2 weeks to come up with
						an innovative and unique idea that could help a specific 
						group of people. For our project, we created an app called
						SnoozZ. Our goal was to help people control how much they
						have been sleeping and help them sleep better. We had a
						built in alarm, music feature, auto data tracking and also
						the option to send your sleep results to your doctors for analysis
						and with the user's consent, the doctors could conduct research
						on find cures or medicine for sleep deprivation or oversleeping. 
						We built our for iOS devices using Xcode 7.3.1 which is a coding platform
						for Apple along with a simulator and our language was Swift 2.0 which is also
						a unique language specifically for Xcode and Apple. We also incorporated the a unique 
						feature which was that we also used your BMI to calculate your hours of sleep so 
						rather than getting a general range the user should be sleeping, they got the exact 
						number of hours they should be sleeping which is personalized to them. We also
						wanted to make the app completely non self anaylitical so that everything would be 
						done by the code rather than the user. Throughout this, we documented the entire process and you 
						can access the document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUSg13Y2UkntHeLUO8604XLTAPal7QMbeiHsGG3Qlmk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
						At the end of this project, with whatever we had created so far, it was perfectly working. Of course, this was still the prototype so not
						all of the best features were incorporated. Unfortunately, you cannot download the app yet to test it out, but in a few weeks a link 
						will be added here so you can download onto your phone and test it out.

		<p>Description: For this project, we had exactly 2.5 weeks to come up with

						ShowerBuddy. Our goal was to help people control how much water they
						used in the shower and how hot or cold their shower was. been sleeping. We had a
						built in temperature control, time feature, auto data tracking and also
						a hardware component in which we created a device that fit into a 3d printed case 
						and mounted over your shower handle with a touchscreen display that allowed you to
						control your shower. We built our for iOS devices using Xcode 8.3.2 which is a coding platform
						for Apple along with a simulator and our language was Swift 3.0 which is also
						a unique language specifically for Xcode and Apple. We also incorporated another feature in 
						which the app will go through your shower habit history and create a preset shower setting
						for times that you cannot set your shower. The display in your shower also displays the time that
						you have showered keeping the person aware and will allow them to turn off the shower by themselves.
						Throughout this, we documented the entire process and you 
						can access the document <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10nb2T-v9yjKimLH5GnUTIBJ5dC5SNI2ZvdUs4AqhVmw">here</a>.

		<p>Description: For this project, we had 2 weeks to pick a circuit that we woould first
						build in a CDS, then breadboard and eventually print onto a circuit baord.
						As my circuit, I decided to build a low battery indicator. In this circuit, 
						an LED would have a solid light if the power coming in was below a certain
						voltage, in this case 5 volts. If it was above the voltage level, then the LED
						would start to flash. The goal was to have a completely working printed circuit
						board at then end of the 2 weeks. To first build the circuit, I first used Multisim
						which is circuit design software. Once completed, I transferred my circuit onto a 
						breadboard which utilized an LED, a few resistors, a capacitor and a power source
						for which I used a battery. Once I got my breadboard to work, I built it as a PCB
						in Fritzing, another software for designing circuits. This circuit was printed as 
						a PCB on glossy paper. We also had to make a circuit board from scratch which meant
						we started out a piece of copper. The printed circuit was ironed onto the copper which
						was then etched in Ferric Chloride to take away the copper except from the connections 
						between all the different components. Throughout this, I documented the entire process 
						and the document can be accesed <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y7SYqhXCdA3i5-Yycaeq4SMiaoy8b9pvIclaUyE3gQE">here</a>.
						Unfortunately, at the end of this project, my circuit was not working. What I realized is that I might have confused myself when
						printing out the circuit and soldering the components as some of them might have been flipped.

						that was under 16 characters including spaces and had some sort of meaning
						to us. The phrase that I came up with was "Are you alright" without a question mark
						because I was at the 16 character limit. After coming up with my phrase, I first needed to create
