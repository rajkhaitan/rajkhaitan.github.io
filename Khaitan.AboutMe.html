			<h1> About Me </h1>

				<p>My name is Raj Khaitan, and I am a 12th grader at Dublin High School. My career goal is to become a successful software engineer and have my own multi-million dollar start-up. My objective is to get admission into Stanford or UC Berkely as those are 2 amazing colleges that will help me meet my hard goal.

					To be a software engineer, you must be strong at math, science, and IT skills. I strongly believe that I possess these traits to become a software engineer. Software is a very vague topic, so to be specific, I would like to go into the area that specializes in computer software programming. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, Python, PHP, JavaScript and Swift. I am very good at debugging my code and figuring out why my code is malfunctioning. 

					My growing experiences have made me a stronger person. These range from being a leader while in middle school tennis team, or building reputation with strict teachers. Being successful during middle school years has made me a more confident individual willing to take on new challenges. During this time, I have learned to handle failures and disappointments better than I did during my elementary school years.
